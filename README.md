Firebase Authorization App

Technologies Used

- **Android Studio**
- **Kotlin / Java** (depending on your project)
- **Firebase Authentication**
- **Gradle** (build system)
- **XML** (UI design)


How It Works

1. The user opens the app and registers with an **email and password** (Sign Up).  
2. The app securely sends credentials to **Firebase Authentication**.  
3. Once registration is successful, the user can **sign in**.  
4. If authentication succeeds, the app redirects to the **main/home screen**.
